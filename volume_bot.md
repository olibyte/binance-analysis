Approach: monitor for silence, then ride breakout on volume
Philosophy: cut losers early, and let the winners run
Rules:
watch 15m timeframe
if the candle volume exceeds 1k, and the direction is up, open buy stop with R:R 2:1 (only open if RSI is < 50)
if the candle volume exceeds 1k, and the direction is down, open sell stop with R:R 2:1 (only open if RSI is > 50)
Positions held for a max of 5 candles
